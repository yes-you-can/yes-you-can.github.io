It is actually the Indian nationalist historians who have given the epithet of the golden age to the Gupta period. 

Failing to latch on to anything else, the Indian historians justifiably seized upon the documents of the Guptas and used them asa counter argument to the persistent British imperialist propaganda 
that India had no history except for a series of conquests by a succession of invaders.

For historians  writing in the early twentieth century, the “Golden age” had to be a utopia set in the distant past, and the period chosen by those working on the early history of India
was one in which they perceived that the Hindu culture came to be firmly established. 

The glorification of Gupta period, at the time of the independence movement might have been seen as necessary but it no longer is.
