<P>The
violence of 1857 continued to have lasting effect. The fears generated by
the uprising transformed how the British understood their relationship
with the “colonized” and shaped their own expectations of themselves as
“colonizer.” Placing the 1857 Indian uprising within an imperial context
reminds us that methods of colonial rule were developed neither in one
location nor by one individual, and the flows of information from one
colony to another played a crucial role in shaping imperial practice.he mutineers had marched the thirty-six miles to Delhi, taken
control of the city, and secured the support of additional regiments.
Unrest among the sepoys of northern India, which had been apparent for
months, erupted in rebellion on May 10, 1857, when troops stationed
at Meerut turned against their European officers. Within twenty-four hours</P>
<P>The mutineers’ capture of the former capital of the Mughal Empire was
as much a symbolic success as a military victory. Upon their arrival in
the city, the mutineers declared the aged heir to the Mughal throne,
Bahadur Shah Zafar, to be the emblematic leader of the uprising. The
rebellion spread from Delhi – both demographically and geographically –
as peasants, artisans, laborers, and others joined the fighting.</P>
<P>The rebels, who often outnumbered the small British garrisons, experienced
considerable success during the early months of the uprising. Most
famously, in June 1857, the European garrison at Cawnpore surrendered
to their Indian opponents with the understanding that all survivors would
be permitted safe passage to Allahabad via the Ganges.11 The rebel commander,
Nana Sahib, and his followers ambushed the Europeans as they
were boarding the boats, however, killing nearly all of the men and taking
approximately two hundred women and children captive. Two weeks
later, as British troops approached, the rebels killed the women and
children and deposited their remains in a nearby well.12 The events at
Cawnpore immediately went down in the annals of the British Empire
as a striking example of Indian barbarity.</P>
